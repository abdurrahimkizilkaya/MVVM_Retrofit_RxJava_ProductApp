# 📱 Android MVVM App with Retrofit, RecyclerView, Coil and RxJava

This is a sample Android app built with Kotlin that showcases the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern using Retrofit for network requests, RecyclerView for displaying a list of data, Coil for efficient image loading, and RxJava for reactive programming.

The app retrieves data from the `products` endpoint from https://dummyjson.com and displays it in a list using a RecyclerView. The product images are loaded using the Coil library, which provides efficient image loading and caching.

## 🚀 Features

- Utilizes the MVVM architecture pattern for clear separation of concerns and maintainability
- Makes network requests using Retrofit for easy and efficient API calls
- Uses RxJava for reactive programming to handle asynchronous operations and event handling
- Displays a list of data using RecyclerView with efficient data binding and view recycling
- Efficiently loads and caches images using the Coil library
- Includes loading and error states to handle network connectivity issues
- Built with Kotlin and follows modern Android development best practices

## 🏁 Getting Started
